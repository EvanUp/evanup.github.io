I'm Evan M. Williams and I'm currently a third year Computer Science PhD student at Carngie Mellon University. 

My research interests include geometric deep learning, network science, and misinformation diffusion. For the most up-to-date list of my publications, check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=znyBkzIAAAAJ&hl=en).

The goal of this blog is to help me emotionally and technically process ML papers.
